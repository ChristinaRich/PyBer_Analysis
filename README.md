# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

In this analysis, we've created a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Rural and Suburban) for V.Isualize. Using Pandas and Matplotlib we've created a line graph to show the weekly fares for each city type to illustrate the differences in fares and ridership across the three city types. 


## Results
Fares in Urban areas are esignificantly higher than by suburban and rural fares. Rural fares are lower than the other two city types for every month analyzed. Eventhough the average individual fares are higher in Rural areas, there are so few rides and drivers that it doesn't make much of an impact on the total fares.  

### Fare Datapoints by City Type
The table below summarizes key datapoints uncovered in this analysis.

### Fares by City Type by Month

The graph below illustrates the disparity between fares by city type across the first months in 2019.

## Summary

This analysis demonstrates that Urban cities generate the most fares. If the goal is to expand, maybe incentivizing people to become drivers in rural areas would lead to more rides. The high price per ride may also be contributing to low ridership. Perhaps decreasing the prices in urban areas would actually generate more revenue because more riders would participate. However, I think population and available activities are the biggest constraints in this analysis. Urban areas have more people to draw from and more places for these people to go. I would focus on these strengths and devote the most marketing funding towards urban areas.
